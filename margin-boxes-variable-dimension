Replacing 6.3.2 Variable Dimension Computation Rules
####################################################

I argue that the current rules in section 6.3.2[1] of
the current Editor’s Draft (**Current as of July 2012**) for css3-page
are unreasonably hard to implement, under-specified
and not even sufficient for the desired behavior.
More background was posted on www-style[2].

**Note:** This proposal has been integrated into the csseditor’s draft.
The version I replaced is available here:

Development continues within the CSS Working Group.
